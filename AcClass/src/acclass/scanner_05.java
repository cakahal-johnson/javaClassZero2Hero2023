        The java.util.Scanner class is a simple text scanner which can parse 
        primitive types and strings using regular expressions.Following are the 
        important points about Scanner âˆ’

A Scanner breaks its input into tokens using a delimiter pattern,
        which by default matches whitespace.

A scanning operation may block waiting for input.

A Scanner is not safe for multithreaded use without external synchronization.
